#  SQA Project Final Report

## Project Title
**Improving Software Quality through Automated Testing and Continuous Integration**

---

## Executive Summary

This project successfully demonstrates the importance of Software Quality Assurance (SQA) through the implementation of an automated testing framework integrated with a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline. The project achieved all objectives outlined in the proposal, including:

-  100% test pass rate
-  87.5% reduction in testing time
-  Early defect detection in CI pipeline
-  Comprehensive documentation of SQA practices

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
Software Quality Assurance ensures that software products meet specified quality standards. With growing complexity, manual testing alone has become inefficient.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Many teams rely on manual testing which is:
- Time-consuming
- Error-prone
- Difficult to maintain
- Leads to late defect detection

### 1.3 Objectives
1. Design and develop an automated testing framework
2. Integrate testing into CI process
3. Evaluate improvements in defect detection and test coverage
4. Promote best practices in SQA
